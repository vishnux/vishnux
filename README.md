### Hi, I'm Vishnu ðŸ‘‹

I design and develop systems that allow users to work with unstructured documents through natural language. I work primarily with multimodal data systems and creating end-to-end solutions from data processing to model deployment.

* Built multimodal RAG systems that process PDFs, images and videos, handling document parsing, OCR integration, and retrieval optimization.
* Led end-to-end data initiatives as the sole Business Intelligence Analyst to automate pipelines, streamline operations, and drive strategic insights
* Built ML systems for Statistics Canada to identify areas with the highest potential for future electric vehicle adoption, thus enabling strategic planning for critical infrastructure requirements, including charging stations.
* Volunteered with Data for Good Calgary to design emergency response dashboards and developed recommendations for securing human trafficking data in Alberta.
